    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
    BOS Philly is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to reviving and reimagining the tradition of circuit parties in Philadelphia—transforming them into empowering, inclusive experiences that uplift and support the LGBTQ+ community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rooted in the historical spirit of circuit parties, BOS Philly honors the legacy of these events as havens for celebration, connection, and solidarity. Our gatherings—ranging from intimate dance events to large-scale productions—are designed with top-tier production values and international DJs to create unforgettable experiences that invite authentic self-expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    But BOS Philly isn’t just about nightlife—it’s about giving back. Since 2018, the organization has donated over $60,000 to local LGBTQ+ charities through events like “Candyland,” demonstrating our commitment to social impact through celebration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aligned with this vision, our events raise funds that benefit local charities—organizations providing advocacy, health resources, arts & culture programming, and essential social services. We aim to foster community solidarity, visibility, and well-being across Philadelphia's LGBTQ+ landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    We produce large-scale events with international DJs and top-notch production values, held at stunning venues across the city. All proceeds are directed to local LGBTQ+ charities, blending celebration with purpose.

    <h2>Our Programs & Initiatives</h2>
    <div class="programs">
      <div class="program">
        <h3>Pride Party Events</h3>
        <p>
    BOS Philly brings together the ecstatic energy of Pride and the historic spirit of OutFest in a unified series of experiences that celebrate community, visibility, and purpose.
  </p>
  <div class="event-detail">
    <h3>Pride Circuit Events</h3>
    <p>
      During Pride season, BOS Philly curates high-energy circuit-style events—like poolside “Fantasea Island” parties and both indoor and open-air musical extravaganzas—featuring international DJs, immersive production, tropical accents, and luxury cabanas. These events are designed as vibrant, sensory-rich celebrations that uplift LGBTQ+ joy, connection, and visibility while directly supporting local LGBTQ+ charities as a central mission.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="event-detail">
    <h3>OURFest Celebrations</h3>
    <p>
      In mid‑October, BOS Philly aligns with Philadelphia’s historic OutFest tradition—now known as OURfest. This National Coming Out Day festival draws over 35,000 attendees to the heart of the Gayborhood, uniting a parade, resource fairs, live performances, vendor marketplaces, and inclusive programming across generations. Through beautifully staged events and community engagement, BOS Philly honors LGBTQ+ resilience, visibility, and collective celebration.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Across both Pride and OURfest seasons, BOS Philly’s programming reflects its dual commitment: providing immersive, world-class circuit parties while ensuring every gathering delivers tangible benefit to local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities.
  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="program">
        <h3>How We Give Back</h3>
  <p>
    Since 2018, BOS Philly has enthusiastically committed to ensuring that our high-energy celebrations translate into meaningful community support. To date, we have donated over $80,000 to local LGBTQ+ charities—bringing joy while making a real difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    At fundraising events like Candyland, a standout Pride-season highlight, proceeds have gone directly toward impactful organizations. For example, we contributed to the ACLU’s Drag Defense Fund and supported initiatives at the William Way Center, Bebashi, Stonewall Sports, OUTLoud sports and Morris Home and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our approach is simple yet powerful: every ticket purchased isn’t just for a night of celebration—it’s a step toward funding advocacy, health resources, arts & culture programming, and essential social services for LGBTQ+ Philadelphians.
  </p>
  <p>
    BOS Philly takes pride in being more than event producers—we are community partners. As one leader put it, “there’s no group more committed… than BOS,” recognizing our dual role in creating both unforgettable experiences and lasting community impact.
