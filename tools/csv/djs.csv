Throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Abel held residencies at some of the most renowned nightclubs in Miami and New York City, including Club 1235, Sound Factory, Paragon, Salvation, and Space. He also hosted a five-year radio mix show on Miami’s Super Q FM 107 from 1982-1987. It was at Paragon in South Beach, Miami, where Abel truly made a name for himself in the dance community, with his signature blend of heavy, progressive tribal beats and diva anthems. From there, he secured headlining gigs at clubs and events across the globe and became a fixture at San Francisco’s Aftershock and WPPS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1994, Abel teamed up with Ralphi Rosario to form the production and mixing team, Rosabel. Together, they’ve released a full-length album, ROSABEL “The Album,” and an EP on Nervous Records titled “The Unexpected EP: Can You Resist?” Abel is known for his diverse style, blending underground house, deep house, techno, and tech house, and has also created a party brand called “Resist.” So, if you’re looking for an unforgettable night out on the dance floor, be sure to check out one of Abel’s events happening around the world, including in Miami, New York City, and beyond.</p>

<p>Proudly serving a fine selection of house, tech, and tribal beats. I’m rooted in New York club sounds and pumping Jersey Shore classics, but I listen to all dance music and love anything with a groovy beat. I’m addicted to the drums and my sound reflects my deep connection to the rhythm and spiritual feeling I know and love. I’ve found my flow.</p>
